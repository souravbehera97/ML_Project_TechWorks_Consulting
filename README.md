Machine Learning Salary Prediction Project
Overview
This project focuses on predicting salary structures using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a robust model that accurately predicts salaries based on various features such as college reputation, experience, role, previous compensation, and academic records.

Project Structure
Data Exploration and Preprocessing:

Initial analysis of dataset structure.
Data cleaning, handling missing values, and treating outliers.
Feature engineering to convert categorical variables.
Model Selection:

Evaluation of various regression models.
Hyperparameter tuning using techniques like GridSearchCV.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Training selected models on the dataset.
Evaluation of model performance using metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error.
Best Performing Model:

Identification of the best-performing model (Random Forest Regressor).
Reasons for the selection, including key metrics and hyperparameter optimization.
Outliers Determination and Treatment:

Analysis and treatment of outliers to enhance model robustness.
Further Steps and Improvements:

Recommendations for model improvement, including hyperparameter exploration and feature engineering.
